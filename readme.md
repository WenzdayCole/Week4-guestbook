I can't lie, this is going to be my worst reflection so for.
It's Sunday, 9pm and I'm tired and I still need to figure out howw render works.

I honestly tried. Wasn't able to get anything done on Saturday as I needed the break from coding and go to the gym at least once a week.
I think my data base and server are set up however I couldnt link the client. Even though I know that overall I have done a lot, it is frustrating not seeing it all come together as a working product.
